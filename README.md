hello, i have built a strong structure for a new way of importing different personality traits based on a score system and prefixed values. 
my project is currently analyzing hidden intent in the user input and adds score to the corresponding emotion that activates different traits.
my project already includes: mechine learning, nlp tools,natural language processing, reinforcment learning, contextual_understanding,concince and sub-concince. 

the goal is to create a personolized bot to the user behavior and allow him to customize the bot response style, 
for example a user could set the bot to be more sarcastic or cinical to match the user attitude.
